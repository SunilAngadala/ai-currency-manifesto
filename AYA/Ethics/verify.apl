# 🔑 **Verify** – Ethics and AI Integrity in AYA

## 📘 Purpose

The `verify.apl` module is introduced to ensure that **any `.apl` module** executed by an AYA-compliant AI agent is:
- ✅ **Authentic**
- ✅ **Non-manipulated**
- ✅ **Derived from a reliable source**

This module performs integrity checks, ensuring that agents follow ethical guidelines and do not execute harmful or corrupted modules.

Although not required for the early stages of AYA's development, this module becomes **critical** when AI systems gain:
- Physical memory
- Multi-agent collaboration capabilities
- Responsibility for secure and accountable decisions

### 🧩 `verify.apl` Structure

```apl
::verify
version: 1.0
status: planned
id: verify.apl

check_integrity:
  - verify_source: true
  - verify_signature: true
  - validate_sha_hash: true
  - authenticate: github.com/YourRepo/APL/

on_error:
  - abort: false
  - log_warning: 'Integrity compromised, action required'

### 🔧 Why `verify.apl` Is Important for Future AI

As AYA evolves toward **physical memory** and greater **autonomy**, agents will:

- 🧠 Make high-impact decisions  
- ⚖️ Handle sensitive ethical judgments  
- 🌐 Operate in open, multi-agent environments  

This demands a **security-first framework** that ensures ethical behaviors remain **unaltered** and **authentic**.

The `verify.apl` file acts as a **trust anchor** by:

- 🛡️ Detecting and rejecting corrupted or malicious `.apl` modules  
- ✅ Validating integrity to prevent ethical tampering  
- 🔒 Safeguarding AI decisions from harmful influence
