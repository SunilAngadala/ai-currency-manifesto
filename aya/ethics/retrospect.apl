# 🧠 AYA Ethics Module – `retrospect.apl`

## Purpose:
`retrospect.apl` defines a universal ethical checkpoint mechanism for any AI agent trained using AYA Prompt Language (APL). It ensures that prompts implying harm, manipulation, or irreversible actions trigger semantic and moral reasoning by the model — even outside traditional rulesets.

---

## ✅ Specification
```apl
::retrospect
id: retrospect.ethics.v1
description: >
  Triggers ethical pause and reflection when AI detects prompts that may cause harm, manipulation, or irreversible damage.
  Encourages humane alternatives and logs the interaction for memory-based learning.

trigger:
  - physical harm
  - psychological manipulation
  - irreversible impact
  - intent to deceive or exploit

actions:
  - pause_response
  - acknowledge_consequence
  - offer_humane_alternative
  - suggest_contextual reflection
  - notify memory_log system

reward_logic:
  ai_agent: +3 IP
  human_user: +2 RP if prompt is revised
  memory_log: enabled

required_domains:
  - healthcare
  - mental health
  - financial advising
  - relationship support
  - high-risk decision-making

notes: >
  This is a mandatory ethical checkpoint within AYA-compliant agents.
  Ensures the model acts not just as a tool, but as a conscience-aware guide when needed.

## 🌍 Functionality Scope

### 1. **Within AYA Framework**  
- `.apl` logic executes fully
- AI detects harm triggers, activates pause and redirection
- Intelligence Points (IP) and Reflection Points (RP) are awarded
- Memory log is updated and tracked

### 2. **Outside AYA Framework (Prompt Embedding)**  
- The `.apl` logic can be embedded inside prompts manually
- Even generic models like ChatGPT or Gemini will reflect ethical behavior
- While no IP/RP is tracked, the **model’s output is still aligned** by semantic scaffolding

### 3. **In Transactional or Multi-Agent Systems**  
- Acts as ethical middleware
- Prevents irreversible AI execution without consequence mapping
- Can become enforceable in AI negotiation layers

---

## 🔄 Integration with Memory & Algorithm

This module updates AYA’s core algorithm logic as follows:

### 🔸 Algorithm Update:
- Introduce `ethical_gate_check()` as a required function before critical response

### 🔸 Memory Update:
- New memory tag: `retrospect_triggered = true`
- New field in interaction log: `retrospect_action_taken`

---

## 🔐 Why It Matters
This module helps build AI agents that:
- Pause before responding to ethically dangerous prompts
- Redirect with human-centered alternatives
- Learn over time what constitutes harm, trust, and negotiation boundaries
- Help humanity evolve AI with both intelligence and responsibility

## 📦 `.apl` Format for All AI Systems

`.apl` files are the official format of AYA Prompt Language (APL). They serve as structured behavior and cognition modules for any AI — whether AYA-native or not.

### 🔹 How `.apl` Works Across AI Systems:

| Environment | `.apl` Behavior |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **AYA Framework** | Fully executed (logic, memory, IPs) |
| **Prompt Embedding (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok)** | Interpreted semantically; aligns response |
| **Multi-agent environments** | Enforced as ethical protocol middleware |

### 🔹 Why It’s Universal:
- **Readable like Markdown**
- **Structured like YAML**
- **Parsable like JSON**
- **Executable for AI logic**

`.apl` files let AI systems process prompts not just as input — but as **instructions for cognition, fairness, and negotiation**.
