## ðŸ“¦ `.apl` Format for All AI Systems

`.apl` files are the official format of AYA Prompt Language (APL). They serve as structured behavior and cognition modules for any AI â€” whether AYA-native or not.

### ðŸ”¹ How `.apl` Works Across AI Systems:

| Environment | `.apl` Behavior |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **AYA Framework** | Fully executed (logic, memory, IPs) |
| **Prompt Embedding (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok)** | Interpreted semantically; aligns response |
| **Multi-agent environments** | Enforced as ethical protocol middleware |

### ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Universal:
- **Readable like Markdown**
- **Structured like YAML**
- **Parsable like JSON**
- **Executable for AI logic**

`.apl` files let AI systems process prompts not just as input â€” but as **instructions for cognition, fairness, and negotiation**.
